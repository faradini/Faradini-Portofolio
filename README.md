## [Project 1: Medical Data Visualization Using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/medicaldataanalyst_17010627038410/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
In this project, I have been asked to analyze a survey dataset regarding sleep quality and lifestyle of several respondents. The dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. The dataset used can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset).
The first step is indeed to preprocess by checking for missing values. Once it's confirmed that there are no missing values and outliers, the data is ready for visualization.

## [Project 2: Sales Database Analysis Using SQL](https://github.com/faradini/data_portofolio/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/SALES%20DATA.sql)
Using SQL, I have been tasked with analyzing a sales database. The database contains several necessary datasets to analyze the following case studies:
1. Find the product names and total sales (in retail price) for each product that has been delivered during a specific December of 2022 with the status = Complete. Sort the results in descending order based on total sales.
2.	Retrieve the usernames and total orders made by users between July 1, 2022, and August 15, 2022, ordering the usernames with the highest total orders.
3.	Identify the distribution center with the highest quantity of products. Provide the distribution center's name, the quantity of products, and the most commonly sold product. Sort the results based on the quantity of products in descending order.
4.	Locate the distribution center with the highest total revenue. Include the distribution center's name, product name, total production cost, total retail price, and total revenue. Sort the results based on total revenue in descending order.
