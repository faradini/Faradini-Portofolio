# Analyzing Sales Data
Using SQL, I have been tasked with analyzing a sales database. The database contains several necessary datasets to analyze the following case studies:
1. Find the product names and total sales (in retail price) for each product that has been delivered during a specific December of 2022 with the status = Complete. Sort the results in descending order based on total sales.
2. Retrieve the usernames and total orders made by users between July 1, 2022, and August 15, 2022, ordering the usernames with the highest total orders.
3. Identify the distribution center with the highest quantity of products. Provide the distribution center's name, the quantity of products, and the most commonly sold product. Sort the results based on the quantity of products in descending order.
4. Locate the distribution center with the highest total revenue. Include the distribution center's name, product name, total production cost, total retail price, and total revenue. Sort the results based on total revenue in descending order.
Here are the outcomes of the analysis for the specified case studies:
